resume_header_intro:
<p> Hello! I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington studying computational linguistics;
    interested in the intersection of narrative content and knowledge graphs.
  In my spare time I practice yoga (RYT 200), binge-read fiction, and chase after my two cats.  </p>

<p> Previously, I worked at Netflix and Twitter as an analytics engineer and studied
physics at Cal. <a href="/images/myw3schoolsimage.jpg" download>

                       </a>  </p>

<p> I am committed to being part of scientific communities where ideas can be
    shared, and the people who share them, respected.
    Similarly, I believe models should be evaluated for bias and possible impact.
</p>
